first it calls the 6b function, passing in the directory, extension, and afterwork function for it to use
	does async function, passing in the directory and afterwork function
		handles errors

so the directory is passed all the way in to the async function
when it's done, it returns data to the function, which builds an array
when that's done, the initial callback function does the last work

so on this next one, first I can build my input data without worrying about async
then i'll write my final callback, which is printing out in order of queue
then write the callback to fill the urls, and pass that into the url async function

so again:
make input data
call http.get(urlpack, callback) {
	fill the urls(urlpack, callback) {
		print the urls
	}
}
so again:
build
async(urlpack, fillerfunction(urpack, printerfunction(urlpack, logic)));
